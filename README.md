# Interior Squad
This is my first game programming using unity. This project was created with intention to fulfil the grades in my company. Click [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/g0xma8cVuRNMEd5a2) to see the images.

### Why create this game ?  
This game basicly just created to learn how to implement algorithm into game. Algorithm that used in this is game are : 
* Binary space partitioning algorithm implementations to create dungeon.
* Theta star algorithm.
* Dijkstra's shortest algorithm.
* Breadth first search algorithm.

### How to play ?
First, you will start the application and the game will run. Then you are directed to main menu screen. You can set the screen resolutions and game graphics quality in *settings* menu. Click *play* to set how big the map size, how many character you want to play (minimum is 1 and maximum is 4), and what type of character you want to use. Then you will directed to main game section. You can choose available action for each character (Move, Attack, Throw Grenade, Close Door, Open Door). For each action have it own cost, use it wisely.

### The game end point
The game will over if one of the player or enemy side no more character left. If player side have no more character left, then the player **Lose**, else if enemy have no more character left, then the player **Win**

### Others
This project still have dirty code and still buggy because it was my first game programming experience. From this project I had learnt so much about algorithm and how **C#** code work and implemented in *Unity*. It takes around 2 weeks for me to reach this point. **This game is not done yet**, If you want to contributed to this game, you can *fork* and start continue my code. This game just need to create the enemy bot logic. Then the game is done.
